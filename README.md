### Problem Statement
This dashboard helps the retail and wholesale teams of Superstore Giant to better understand sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.  
It provides year-over-year (YoY) sales insights, identifies seasonal trends, highlights the most profitable and best-selling products, and evaluates customer loyalty.  
Using these insights, the company can improve inventory planning, target marketing efforts, and enhance customer retention strategies.

For example, by observing strong seasonal patterns, Superstore Giant can prepare stock for peak sales periods.  
By identifying top customers and regions with growth potential, they can optimize marketing campaigns and drive business expansion.
